# RoamRover

This is a robot car that has automatic and manual functionalities. When operated in automatic mode, it can either be a line following or obstacle avoiding robot car. In manual mode, the robot car can be controlled using a wireless joystick controller.

As a line following robot car, it is able to follow a path mapped out with a black line.
As an obstacle avoiding robot car, it is able to navigate a maze by proceeding in the direction that is not obstructed.

The robot car and its controller were created using an Arduino Uno and Arduino Nano board.
The gear motors were controlled using an L298N motor driver.
The wireless communication was facilitated using NRF24L01 modules.
